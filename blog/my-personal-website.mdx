# Greetings, fellow humans!

My name is Asyraf and I am a 21-year-old information systems student. I am super thrilled to welcome you to my personal website, where I will share my awesome projects and writings with you.

# Why did I create this website?

Ever since I was a kid, I have been fascinated by technology and how it can create amazing things. I love to code, design, build web apps, and anything else that sparks my curiosity. I wanted to have a platform where I can showcase my work and skills, as well as express my thoughts and opinions on various topics. I also wanted to challenge myself to learn new technologies and tools, and to improve my web development skills. Plus, having a personal website is cool, right? ðŸ˜Ž

# What Is the Content of My Personal Website?

On this website, you will find two main sections: projects and blog. In the projects section, you will see some of the projects that I have created or contributed to, in the blog section, you will read some of my writings about various things.

# What Technologies Did I Use to Create This Website?

This website was created with React, NextJS 14, TailwindCSS v3, and several supporting packages. I chose these technologies because they are modern, fast, and easy to use. They also have great documentation and community support. I also used some APIs and libraries to add some features and functionalities.
