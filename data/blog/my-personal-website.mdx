# Greetings, fellow humans!

Welcome to my personal website! My name is **Asyraf** and I am a 21-year-old information systems student. I am super thrilled to welcome you to my personal website, where I will share my awesome projects and writings with you. Let me tell you a bit more about them.

# What Is This Website About?

This website is a place where I showcase my skills, interests, and passions in the field of technology especially software engineering kind of things. I have always been fascinated by how technology can solve problems, improve lives, and create opportunities. That is why I decided to pursue a degree in information systems and learn how to design, develop, and manage systems where hopefuly it will be beneficial for us.

On this website, you will find some of the projects that I have worked on or contributed to, either as part of my coursework, personal hobbies, or professional experience. You will also find my blog, where I write about various topics related to computer science, software engineering, such as trends, challenges, best practices, tips, and tricks. And of course, not only those specific topics that i will be discussing here in my blog, it can be some random things that came out of my mind.

# Why did I create this website?

Ever since I was a kid, I have been fascinated by technology and how it can create amazing things. I love to code, design, build web apps, and anything else that sparks my curiosity. I wanted to have a platform where I can showcase my work, skills, and achievements because I think having a portfolio is a great way to demonstrate my abilities and potential to future employers, clients, or collaborators. Then, also where i can express my thoughts and opinions on various topics.

I really enjoy writing and sharing my insights with others who are interested in the same field. After all, I wanted to have a personal space where I can introduce myself and connect with people who share similar interests, passions, or goals. I believe that networking and building relationships are very important for personal and professional growth. I also wanted to challenge myself to learn new technologies and tools, and to improve my web development skills. Plus, having a personal website is cool, right? ðŸ˜Ž

# What Technologies Did I Use to Create This Website?

I used a combination of technologies to create this website:
* [**React**](https://react.dev/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces that I used to create the front-end of my website.
* [**Next.js 14**](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework that enables fast and easy web development.
* [**Tailwind CSS v3**](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework that allows me to style my website with minimal effort and maximum flexibility.
* [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/) - Hosting service that lets me publish my website directly from my GitHub repository.
* [**GitHub Actions**](https://github.com/features/actions) - Workflow automation tool that helps me deploy my website automatically whenever I push changes to my repository.

I chose these technologies because they are modern, fast, and easy to use. They also have great documentation and community support.
